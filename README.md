## Getting Started

To start a Snow Mercy invasion, the player can either use a command or a Frozen Compass.

### Commands

- ``/snowmercy start`` will start a Snow Mercy invasion if one isn't already active.
- ``/snowmercy stop`` will stop a Snow Mercy invasion if one is currently active.

### Survival Way

To start a Snow Mercy invasion in survival, the player will need to acquire both a Frozen Compass and a Lodestone. By surrounding a Compass with three pieces of Blue Ice and a Snow Block on top in a crafting table, the player can obtain the Frozen Compass.

After crafting a Frozen Compass, the player can then use it on a Lodestone in order to start a Snow Mercy invasion; this action consuming the compass. The Lodestone will then turn into a Frozen Lodestone, and breaking it will stop the invasion, along with dropping a Lodestone.
